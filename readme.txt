Command needs to run:
1. pip3 install pipenv
2. pipenv shell (It should launch a virtual environment)
3. pipenv install selenium (It'll create two files in the folder: Pipfile & Pipfile.lock)
4. python script.py (The browser should open with the URL and should start executing the script automatically)
